It was broadcast on BBC One from 20 September 2008 to 24 December 2012. The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his relationship with Arthur Pendragon but differs from traditional versions in many ways. The show was influenced by the US drama series Smallville, about the early years of Superman, and was produced by independent production company Shine Limited.\n\nThe show was greenlit by the BBC in 2006, after unsuccessful attempts. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",

It was broadcast on BBC One from 20 September 2008 to 24 December 2012. The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his relationship with Arthur Pendragon but differs from traditional versions in many ways. The show was influenced by the US drama series Smallville, about the early years of Superman, and was produced by independent production company Shine Limited.\n\nThe show was greenlit by the BBC in 2006, after unsuccessful attempts. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",

Cy Endfield co-wrote the epic prequel Zulu Dawn 15 years after his enormously popular Zulu. Set in 1879, this film depicts the catastrophic Battle of Isandhlwana, which remains the worst defeat of the British army by natives, with the British contingent outnumbered 16-to-1 by the Zulu tribesmen. The film's opinion of events is made immediately clear in its title sequence: ebullient African village life presided over by King Cetshwayo is contrasted with aristocratic artifice under the arrogant eye of General Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole). Chelmsford is at the heart of all that goes wrong, initiating the catastrophic battle with an ultimatum made seemingly for the sake of giving his troops something to do. His detached  manner leads to one mistake after another.",

Talking heads yelling from every TV camera blame everything from Satan to video games. But are we that much different from many other countries? What sets us apart? How have we become both the master and victim of such enormous amounts of violence? This is not a film about gun control. It is a film about the fearful heart and soul of the United States, and the 280 million Americans lucky enough to have the right to a constitutionally protected Uzi. From a look at the Columbine High School security camera tapes to the home of Oscar-winning NRA President Charlton Heston, from a young man who makes homemade napalm with The Anarchist's Cookbook to the murder of a six-year-old girl by another six-year-old, Bowling for Columbine is a journey through America, through our past, hoping to discover why our pursuit of happiness is so riddled with violence.",

Its central plot revolves around a somewhat anthropomorphic pink/purple dog named Courage who lives with his owners, Muriel and Eustace Bagge, an elderly, married farming couple in the \"Middle of Nowhere\". Courage and his owners are frequently thrown into bizarre misadventures, often involving the paranormal/supernatural and various villains. The show is known for its surreal, often disquieting humor and bizarre plot twists. The series combines elements of comedy horror, science fantasy, and drama.\n\nThe program originated from a short on Cartoon Network's animation showcase series created by Hanna-Barbera president Fred Seibert, \"What a Cartoon!\" titled \"The Chicken from Outer Space\". The segment was nominated for an Academy Award in 1996, and Cartoon Network commissioned a series based on the short. The series, which premiered on November 12, 1999, ran for four seasons, ending on November 22, 2002 with a total of 52 episodes produced. The series was the sixth and final series to be spun off from World Premiere Toons, and it was the eighth series to fall under the Cartoon Cartoons label.",

Each season of The Wire introduces a different facet of the city of Baltimore. In chronological order they are: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media.\n\nDespite only receiving average ratings and never winning major television awards, The Wire has been described by many critics and fans as one of the greatest TV dramas of all time. The show is recognized for its realistic portrayal of urban life, its literary ambitions, and its uncommonly deep exploration of sociopolitical themes.",

A spin-off from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, each story was introduced by Freddy Krueger. This format is essentially the same as that employed by Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Tales from the Crypt, or The Twilight Zone. The pilot episode was directed by Tobe Hooper, and begins with Freddy Krueger's acquittal of the child-murdering charges due to his officer's lack of reviewing the Miranda warning at the time of Freddy's arrest. A mob of parents eventually corners Freddy in a power plant, leading to him being torched by the police officer, dying and gaining his familiar visage.\n\nThe series was produced by New Line Television, producers of the film series. It was originally distributed by Lorimar-Telepictures. However, Warner Bros. Television would assume syndication rights after acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures.",

The series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. It was originally going to be titled Jump Street Chapel, after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters, but was changed at Fox's request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program.\n\nCreated by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell, the series was produced by Patrick Hasburgh Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television. Executive Producers included Hasburgh, Cannell, Steve Beers and Bill Nuss. The show was an early hit for the fledgling Fox Network, and was created to attract a younger audience. The final season aired in first-run syndication mainly on local Fox affiliates. It was later rerun on the FX cable network from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe series provided a spark to Johnny Depp's nascent acting career, garnering him national recognition as a teen idol. Depp found this status irritating, but he continued on the series under his contract and was paid $45,000 per episode. Eventually he was released from his contract after the fourth season. A spin-off series, Booker, was produced for the character of Dennis Booker; it ran one season, from September 1989 to June 1990. A film adaptation starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was released on March 16, 2012.",

The title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name and most of the content originated in that comic or the four other EC Comics of the time. The show was produced by HBO with uncredited association by The Geffen Film Company and Warner Bros. Television. The series is not to be confused with the 1972 film by the same name or Tales from the Darkside, another similarly themed horror anthology series.\n\nBecause it was aired on HBO, a premium cable television channel, it was one of the few anthology series to be allowed to have full freedom from censorship by network standards and practices as a result, HBO allowed the series to contain graphic violence as well as other content that had not appeared in most television series up to that time, such as profanity, gore, nudity and sexual situations, which could give the series a TV-MA rating for today's standards. The show is subsequently edited for such content when broadcast in syndication or on basic cable. While the series began production in the United States, in the final season filming moved to Britain, resulting in episodes which revolved around British characters.",

Paris, the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta, to leave her husband Menelaus, and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnom to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans.",

Guardians never takes itself too seriously which makes this movie a whole lot of fun.\r\n\r\nThe cast was perfectly chosen and even though two of the main five were CG, knowing who voiced and acted alongside them completely filled out these characters.\r\n\r\nGuardians of the Galaxy is one of those rare complete audience pleasers. Good fun for everyone!",

A filmek cselekménye a Galaktikus Köztársaság és a Galaktikus Birodalom közti átmenetek, valamint a Galaktikus Polgárháború (amely a Lázadó Szövetség és a Galaktikus Birodalom között zajlik) körül forog.

You can get a valid list of certifications from the [certifications list](#endpoint:faFKjuKG2HnwexAWM) method.\n\nDiscover also supports a nice list of sort options. See below for all of the available options.\n\nPlease note, when using `certification` \\ `certification.lte` you must also specify `certification_country`. These two parameters work together in order to filter the results. You can only filter results with the countries we have added to our [certifications list](#endpoint:faFKjuKG2HnwexAWM).\n\nIf you specify the `region` parameter, the regional release date will be used instead of the primary release date. The date returned will be the first date based on your query (ie. if a `with_release_type` is specified). It's important to note the order of the release types that are used. Specifying \"2|3\" would return the limited theatrical release date as opposed to \"3|2\" which would return the theatrical date.\n\nAlso note that a number of filters support being comma (`,`) or pipe (`|`) separated. Comma's are treated like an `AND` and query while pipe's are an `OR`. \n\nSome examples of what can be done with discover can be found [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/discover).",

Only 2015 I decided to continue watching and got addicted like it seemed complicated at first, too many stories and characters. I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. \r\n\r\nFantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises!",

The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. \r\n\r\nAnd all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.",

En très peu de temps, il devient une véritable star et sa collaboration avec le réalisateur David Fincher donne naissance aux films cultes Seven, Fight Club et L'Étrange Histoire de Benjamin Button. Il tourne dans de nombreux autres succès comme Entretien avec un vampire de Neil Jordan, Ocean's Eleven et ses suites de Steven Soderbergh, Troie de Wolfgang Petersen, Inglourious Basterds de Quentin Tarantino et World War Z de Marc Forster. Au cours de sa carrière, il a reçu quatre nominations aux Oscars et cinq nominations aux Golden Globes, dont un remporté pour L'Armée des douze singes de Terry Gilliam en 1996.\n\nSex-symbol des années 1990, Brad Pitt est le premier acteur élu deux fois « Homme le plus sexy du monde » par le magazine People en 1995 et en 2000. Avec sa femme Angelina Jolie (rencontrée sur le tournage de Mr et Mrs Smith et qui a demandé le divorce en septembre 2016), il est le père de 6 enfants. Leur couple est très médiatisé dans les années 2000, y compris dans leurs actions humanitaires (à l'occasion notamment du tsunami de 2004 et de l'ouragan Katrina).\n\nÀ partir de 2002, il s'investit dans la production via sa société Plan B Entertainment avec des films tels que Les Infiltrés de Martin Scorsese et Twelve Years a Slave de Steve McQueen, qui ont chacun été récompensés par l'Oscar du meilleur film en 2007 et 2014, The Tree of Life de Terrence Malick, qui a reçu la Palme d'or au Festival de Cannes en 2011, ou des succès publics comme World War Z."

William Bradley Pitt; 18 декабря 1963 года, Шони, Оклахома, США), более известный как Брэд Питт (Brad Pitt) — американский актёр и продюсер. Лауреат премии «Золотой глобус» за 1995 год — за роль второго плана в ленте «Двенадцать обезьян».

It was broadcast on BBC One from 20 September 2008 to 24 December 2012. The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his relationship with Arthur Pendragon but differs from traditional versions in many ways. The show was influenced by the US drama series Smallville, about the early years of Superman, and was produced by independent production company Shine Limited.\n\nThe show was greenlit by the BBC in 2006, after unsuccessful attempts. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",

As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source. Meanwhile Neo's recurrent dreams depicting Trinity's death have got him worried and as if it was not enough, Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion, has become more powerful than before and has fixed Neo as his next target.",

When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.",

There is one exception which is image languages. They are currently only designated by a ISO-639-1 tag. This is a planned upgrade for the future.\n\nWe're always open to adding more if you think one should be added. You can ask about getting a new primary translation added by posting on [the forums](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047951f760ee3318900009a).\n\nOne more thing to mention, these are the translations that map to our website translation project.

You can see which type the original file is by looking at the `file_type` field. We prefer SVG's as they are resolution independent and as such, the width and height are only there to reflect the original asset that was uploaded. An SVG can be scaled properly beyond those dimensions if you call them as a PNG.\n\nFor more information about how SVG's and PNG's can be used, take a read through [this document](#docTextSection:mXP9B2uzoDJFguDZv).",

It is recommended you cache this data within your application and check for updates every few days.\n\nThis method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change key map.\n\nTo build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The `base_url`, `size` and `file_path`. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL. Here’s an example URL:\n\n    https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8uO0gUM8aNqYLs1OsTBQiXu0fEv.jpg\n\nThe configuration method also contains the list of change keys which can be useful if you are building an app that consumes data from the change feed.",

It is the first The Real Housewives program in the franchise. The series is a voyeuristic look into the wealthy lives of these housewives, as they shop, get plastic surgery, gossip, fight and live lavishly. The financial crisis, the beginning of which coincided almost exactly with the first season's broadcast, has since trimmed the housewives' lifestyles with job losses, evictions, mortgage defaults, foreclosures, and marital stress—all recorded in progressive seasons of the show.",

Neds hustru Catelyn forteller at hans mentor, Jon Arryn, har dødd i hovedstaden Kongshavn, og at kong Robert er på vei nordover for å tilby Ned stillingen som kongens hånd. Viserys Targaryen vil danne en allianse med de nomadiske Dothraki-krigerne ved å gi sin søster Daenerys til deres leder, khal Drogo. Robert ankommer med sin hustru, dronning Cersei, og andre fra Lannister-slekten: Hennes tvillingbror Jaime, dvergbroren Tyrion og hennes sønn og tronarving Joffrey. Ned kan ikke si nei til sin gamle venn kongen, og Jon Snø velger å verve seg i Nattevakten. Men en grufull handling mot unge Bran kan stanse alle planer."

Following the super-sized dud that was _Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice_ released a few months ago must really put some major pressure on Warner Bros. to gamble on ensuring that the presence of **Suicide Squad** does not meet the same kind of indifferent reception. Well, it turns out that although the anticipation was high for writer-director David Ayer's supervillain saga involving high-powered imprisoned rogues recruited as U.S. governmental operatives out to stop other skillful baddies (as it was for Zack Ryder's aforementioned \"Dawn of Justice\") the concoction of **Suicide Squad** feels like a colorful mishmash of collective misfits laboriously taking up space in a disjointed eye candy-coated spectacle that never manages to match its intended sizzle.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the premise for **Suicide Squad** would tap into the intriguing naughtiness with more robust gumption given the collection of super-powered oddballs asked to be immediate anti-heroes in this toothless jamboree of renegade rejects. Strangely, the grim and brooding presentation of **Suicide Squad** is more of an erratic downer than a hyperactive high-wire act as intended at the creative hands of Ayer. There is no reason why this lively group of adventurous agitators should appear so flat and inconsequential in a boisterous blockbuster that sporadically limps.\r\n\r\nGiven the twisted members that comprise this elite team of terrorizing tools it is very disappointing to see how **Suicide Squad** struggles with its so-called subversive themes. Sadly, this splattered mess never firmly grasps its bid for distinctive irreverence or off-balance exploitation. Instead, **Squad** feels strained in its execution and we are never really invested in entirely watching these treasured troublemakers find redemption because the story is soggy and uninspired. Furthermore, not all of the **Squad** participants are fleshed out satisfyingly for us to get behind with thirsty cynicism. The headlining leads in Will Smith's Floyd Lawton/Deadshot, Oscar-winner Jared Leto's green-haired Joker and Australian beauty Margot Robbie's Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn get the meaty standout parts while the lesser known supporting cast get stuck with chewing on the thankless remaining bone while seemingly acting as background furniture to the bigger names.\r\n\r\nNaturally, desperation has set in for the U.S. government as they need to safeguard national security against advanced sinister forces that threaten the fiber of American self-interests everywhere. What better way to hire gifted protection than to consider employing the world's most incarcerated corruptible, cutthroat cretins to perform the dirty work in unforgivable mission ops that require death-defying determination. Enter U.S. Intelligence agent Amanda Waller (Oscar nominee Viola Davis). Waller's duties are to assemble the ragtag team known as the Suicide Squad--ominous (yet talented) jailbirds tapped to step in and assume superhero status (especially when the real superheroes are tied up in other crime-stopping affairs) while helping out for the greater good of our vulnerable society. In exchange for the Suicide Squad's sacrifice in turning from hell-bent heels to reluctant heralded heroes they are promised commuted prison sentences should they effectively defend and destroy the deadly foes out to promote heavy-handed havoc across the board.\r\n\r\nConveniently, bureaucratic bigwig Waller (through voiceover) introduces the Suicide Squad and describes what beneficial assets they bring to the turbulent table. Among the naughty notables include the well-known ace sniper Floyd Lawton/Deadshot as well as legendary lethal joy-boy Joker and his better (or perhaps worst half) in girlfriend Harley Quinn. The other toxic tag-a-longs along for the thrill ride of becoming rebellious rescuers include George Harkness/Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Chato Santana/El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Waylon Jones/Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana, Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman).\r\n\r\nOverall, **Suicide Squad** is surprisingly depressing and goes through the proverbial motions without so much as taking advantage of its surrealistic makeup. The movie never realizes its excitable potential and drifts into yet another superhero yarn that is more patchy than pronounced. Smith's Deadshot is out in the forefront but for the most part feels restrained and not as spry and savvy as one would imagine. Leto's Joker obviously pales in comparison to the brilliant and mesmerizing psychotic take on the role that earned the late Heath Ledger his posthumous Oscar statuette. In all fairness, nobody could inhabit the Clown Prince of Crime as Ledger uncannily did with committed concentration. Still, Leto's Joker--although viciously off-balance--felt recycled and furiously empty at times. Robbie's turn as Joker's misguided main squeeze merely comes off as a bratty Barbie Doll with synthetic edginess. The other **Squad** participants settle for the back burner more or less which is a crying shame because they should have been more engaged than the tepid material allowed them to be initially.\r\n\r\nWoefully sketchy and missing the fueled opulence that one would expect emerging from this cockeyed costume caper **Suicide Squad** is a detonating dud for the missing explosive DC Comics movie brand that needs to step up the pace if they expect to make a consistent and challenging impression on the devoted fanboys at the box office looking to move beyond the sardonic fantasy-based realm of another redundant serving of a _Batman/Superman_ entry.\r\n\r\n**Suicide Squad** (2016)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 3 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margo Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez, Jai Courtney, Scott Eastwood, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Common, Cara Delevinge, Karen Fukuhara, Adam Beach\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: David Ayer\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Superheroes Saga/Action & Adventure/Comic Book Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016)",

A spin-off from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, each story was introduced by Freddy Krueger. This format is essentially the same as that employed by Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Tales from the Crypt, or The Twilight Zone. The pilot episode was directed by Tobe Hooper, and begins with Freddy Krueger's acquittal of the child-murdering charges due to his officer's lack of reviewing the Miranda warning at the time of Freddy's arrest. A mob of parents eventually corners Freddy in a power plant, leading to him being torched by the police officer, dying and gaining his familiar visage.\n\nThe series was produced by New Line Television, producers of the film series. It was originally distributed by Lorimar-Telepictures. However, Warner Bros. Television would assume syndication rights after acquiring Lorimar-Telepictures.",

The series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. It was originally going to be titled Jump Street Chapel, after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters, but was changed at Fox's request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program.\n\nCreated by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell, the series was produced by Patrick Hasburgh Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television. Executive Producers included Hasburgh, Cannell, Steve Beers and Bill Nuss. The show was an early hit for the fledgling Fox Network, and was created to attract a younger audience. The final season aired in first-run syndication mainly on local Fox affiliates. It was later rerun on the FX cable network from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe series provided a spark to Johnny Depp's nascent acting career, garnering him national recognition as a teen idol. Depp found this status irritating, but he continued on the series under his contract and was paid $45,000 per episode. Eventually he was released from his contract after the fourth season. A spin-off series, Booker, was produced for the character of Dennis Booker; it ran one season, from September 1989 to June 1990. A film adaptation starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was released on March 16, 2012.",

The title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name and most of the content originated in that comic or the four other EC Comics of the time. The show was produced by HBO with uncredited association by The Geffen Film Company and Warner Bros. Television. The series is not to be confused with the 1972 film by the same name or Tales from the Darkside, another similarly themed horror anthology series.\n\nBecause it was aired on HBO, a premium cable television channel, it was one of the few anthology series to be allowed to have full freedom from censorship by network standards and practices as a result, HBO allowed the series to contain graphic violence as well as other content that had not appeared in most television series up to that time, such as profanity, gore, nudity and sexual situations, which could give the series a TV-MA rating for today's standards. The show is subsequently edited for such content when broadcast in syndication or on basic cable. While the series began production in the United States, in the final season filming moved to Britain, resulting in episodes which revolved around British characters.",

Pierwszorzędne role wiodą rodziny: Stark, Lannister i Baratheon. Robert Baratheon, król Westeros, prosi swojego starego przyjaciela, Eddarda Starka, aby służył jako jego główny doradca. Eddard, podejrzewając, że jego poprzednik na tym stanowisku został zamordowany, przyjmuje propozycję, aby dogłębnie zbadać sprawę. Okazuje się, że przejęcie tronu planuje kilka rodzin. Lannisterowie, familia królowej, staje się podejrzana o podstępne knucie spisku. Po drugiej stronie morza, pozbawieni władzy ostatni przedstawiciele poprzednio rządzącego rodu, Targaryenów, również planują odzyskać kontrolę nad królestwem. Narastający konflikt pomiędzy rodzinami, do którego włączają się również inne rody, prowadzi do wojny. W międzyczasie na dalekiej północy budzi się starodawne zło. W chaosie pełnym walk i konfliktów tylko grupa wyrzutków zwana Nocną Strażą stoi pomiędzy królestwem ludzi, a horrorem kryjącym się poza nim.",

Denne middelalderlige verden er fuld af kæmper, profetier og fortryllede skove, og bag en mur af is, der adskiller Riget, truer spøgelser og andre farer. Men de overnaturlige elementer er ikke rigtig så fremtrædende i serien. Den narrative ramme er den hensynsløse kamp om magten, hvilket involverer en række konger, riddere og herremænd med navne som Baratheon, Stark og Lannister. Det er ingen opløftende historie, hvor det gode nødvendigvis sejrer frem for det onde, eller hvor det egentlig er så let at afgøre, hvad der er godt og ondt. Men Martin formår at tryllebinde publikum - også dem, der normalt ikke synes om magi og fantasiverdener.",

Gleichzeitig droht der Wintereinbruch und es zeichnet sich eine Gefahr durch eine fremde Rasse im hohen Norden von Westeros ab.

Între timp, tronul e amenințat din Est, de prințesa adolescentă Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) și fratele ei Viserys (Harry Lloyd), ambii în exil după ce familia lor, aflată la conducerea regatului vreme de mulți ani, a fost masacrată. Și există zvonuri cum că s-ar petrece lucruri ciudate la marginea regatului, la nord de zid, unde Jon Snow(Kit Harington), fiul ilegitim al lui Ned, face parte din frăția Paznicilor Nopții, care a jurat să păzească Regatul.\n\nRegi și regine, cavaleri și renegați, mincinoși, lorzi și oameni cinstiți vor juca \"Urzeala tronurilor\" și vor lupta pentru putere pentru că aici fie câștigi, fie mori",

It was broadcast on BBC One from 20 September 2008 to 24 December 2012. The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his relationship with Arthur Pendragon but differs from traditional versions in many ways. The show was influenced by the US drama series Smallville, about the early years of Superman, and was produced by independent production company Shine Limited.\n\nThe show was greenlit by the BBC in 2006, after unsuccessful attempts. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",

He could march his men over 100 miles in a day to recapture a town from the Germans. \"Attack, attack and attack again\" was his motto. He predicted a spectacular death for himself, but sadly, he died from injuries suffered from an auto accident. MacArthur - He had a spirit of intense determination. When he left the Philippines he promised he would return, rescuing every prisoner in Manila. Toward the end of his military career he said, \"That old soldiers never die, they just fade away\". Eisenhower - A graduate of West Point, He was Chief of Staff of the 3rd Army and became 34th President of the U.S.",

Cy Endfield co-wrote the epic prequel Zulu Dawn 15 years after his enormously popular Zulu. Set in 1879, this film depicts the catastrophic Battle of Isandhlwana, which remains the worst defeat of the British army by natives, with the British contingent outnumbered 16-to-1 by the Zulu tribesmen. The film's opinion of events is made immediately clear in its title sequence: ebullient African village life presided over by King Cetshwayo is contrasted with aristocratic artifice under the arrogant eye of General Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole). Chelmsford is at the heart of all that goes wrong, initiating the catastrophic battle with an ultimatum made seemingly for the sake of giving his troops something to do. His detached  manner leads to one mistake after another.",

More information about user authentication can be found [here](#docTextSection:NSZtgz7zptsiLYxXZ).\n\nPlease note, you should only generate a single guest session per user (or device) as you will be able to attach the ratings to a TMDb user account in the future. There is also IP limits in place so you should always make sure it's the end user doing the guest session actions.\n\nIf a guest session is not used for the first time within 24 hours, it will be automatically deleted.",

For the driven inhabitants of this visionary world, control of Westeros' Iron Throne holds the lure of great power. But in a land where the seasons can last a lifetime, winter is coming...and beyond the Great Wall that protects them, an ancient evil has returned. In Season One, the story centers on three primary areas: the Stark and the Lannister families, whose designs on controlling the throne threaten a tenuous peace; the dragon princess Daenerys, heir to the former dynasty, who waits just over the Narrow Sea with her malevolent brother Viserys; and the Great Wall--a massive barrier of ice where a forgotten danger is stirring.",

Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.",

Perkins, John Pardee, Joey Murphy, David Grossman, and Larry Shaw.\n\nThe main setting of the show was Wisteria Lane, a street in the fictional American town of 'Fairview' in the fictional 'Eagle State'. The show followed the lives of a group of women as seen through the eyes of a dead neighbor who committed suicide in the very first episode. The storyline covers thirteen years of the women's lives over eight seasons, set between the years 2004–2008, and later 2013–2017. They worked through domestic struggles and family life, while facing the secrets, crimes and mysteries hidden behind the doors of their — at the surface — beautiful and seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood.\n\nThe show featured an ensemble cast, headed by Teri Hatcher as Susan Mayer, Felicity Huffman as Lynette Scavo, Marcia Cross as Bree Van de Kamp, and Eva Longoria as Gabrielle Solis. Brenda Strong narrated the show as the deceased Mary Alice Young, appearing sporadically in flashbacks or dream sequences.",

Táto \"výmena názorov\" sa obom zapáči a čoskoro vznikne prvý Klub bitkárov. Miesto, kde môžu mladí muži, znechutení svetom, odložiť svoje starosti a stať sa na pár minút zvieratami.",

You can see which type the original file is by looking at the `file_type` field. We prefer SVG's as they are resolution independent and as such, the width and height are only there to reflect the original asset that was uploaded. An SVG can be scaled properly beyond those dimensions if you call them as a PNG.\n\nFor more information about how SVG's and PNG's can be used, take a read through [this document](#docTextSection:mXP9B2uzoDJFguDZv).",

Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.",
